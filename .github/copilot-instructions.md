# BossBooker - GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

BossBooker is a booking management system designed to help businesses manage their appointments, reservations, and scheduling needs efficiently. This repository is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Project Goals

- Provide an intuitive interface for managing bookings and appointments
- Enable efficient scheduling and calendar management
- Support multiple user roles (administrators, staff, customers)
- Ensure scalability and maintainability

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic or business rules
- Follow consistent formatting and style conventions
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

### Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for all new business logic
- Ensure test coverage for critical functionality
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Run all tests before committing changes

### Documentation

- Keep README.md up to date with project changes
- Document all public APIs and interfaces
- Include examples in documentation where helpful
- Document setup and configuration steps clearly

### Security Best Practices

- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, credentials)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow security best practices for authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies up to date and review security advisories

### Git Workflow

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
- Ensure code builds and tests pass before pushing
